# Changelog

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- ASCII art logo on the loading screen
- Extract star animation into dedicated module

### Fixed
- KPI values and card costs now reflect the actual time window for 1H and 12H filters (sub-day minute-level filtering)
- Fix 1H and 12H filters ignoring data from the previous day when the time window crosses midnight — KPIs, cards, and model stats now correctly include yesterday's data
- Fix panic on non-ASCII characters (accented letters, emoji, CJK) in project rename and search inputs — cursor now navigates by character boundaries instead of raw bytes
- Fix `truncate_str` panic when truncation falls in the middle of a multi-byte UTF-8 character
- Fix search bar and rename modal cursor position being offset when text contains multi-byte characters
- Fix ←/→ project navigation order not matching the displayed card order — navigation now follows the visual sort (starred first, then by cost) instead of alphabetical

### Changed
- KPI "Avg/day" label switches to "Total tokens" in sub-day views (1H, 12H, Today) for clarity
- Track `cache_read`, `cache_creation`, `lines_added`, and `lines_deleted` in the compact event index
